<h2>AutoGate boarding bridge and docking guidance system kit
for X-Plane<small><sup>&reg;</sup></small></h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This kit allows X-Plane scenery designers to add animated
boarding bridges and docking guidance systems (DGS) to scenery
packages. One boarding bridge and one DGS (a Safedock<small><sup>&reg;</sup></small>
2S) are supplied.</p>
<p>The boarding bridge animates to "dock" with the plane's main
door when the pilot shuts down the plane's engines with the plane
within &frac12;m of the correct stopping position. The
(optional) DGS guides the pilot to the correct stopping position. A
summary of the Safedock<small><sup>&reg;</sup></small>
2S DGS is provided <a href="Safedock%20Pilot%20Instructions.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>The boarding bridge and DGS scenery objects are animated using
X-Plane custom datarefs. The values of these datarefs are supplied by a
plugin. The plugin needs to know the location of the main door on the
plane that the user is flying; the plugin currently only knows this for
some planes, including the default United 747.</p>
<p>The system is designed so that it imposes no more load on
X-Plane than normal "static" scenery objects unless the user's
viewpoint is within 1000m of a boarding bridge or 500m of a DGS, in
which case the load remains very modest.</p>
<p>If the plugin is not installed or if the user is piloting an
unrecognised plane then the DGS will stay blank and the boarding bridge
will stay in the undocked position.</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Copy the plugin from the <code>plugins</code>
folder to your <code>X-Plane/Resources/plugins</code>
folder. Please do not re-distribute the plugin with your scenery
package; ask your users to download it from <a href="http://marginal.org.uk/x-planescenery/AutoGate.zip">http://marginal.org.uk/x-planescenery/AutoGate.zip</a>
instead. This ensures that they have the latest version. <small>(Future
versions of the plugin may support more bridges and/or DGSs, but will
will remain backwards-compatible)</small>. That download does not
contain any documentation on the operation of the boarding bridge or
DGS - you may wish to supply such documentation with your
scenery package.
</p>
<p>The boarding bridge object is <code>AutoGate.obj</code>.
A static v7 version of this object is supplied in the <code>v7objs</code>
folder for use in X-Plane v7 WorldMaker. Place as many copies of <code>AutoGate.obj</code>
as you like in your scenery:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The bridge should be placed with the heading that
you want the plane to have when it stops at the gate.</li>
  <li>Do not place bridges with their origins within 20m of each
other. For reference, the distance between the "elbow" and "wrist" is
20m and the distance between the extended centreline and the "elbow" is
10m.</li>
</ul>
<p>Various versions of the DGS object are provided, eg <code>Safedock2S-6m.obj</code>.
These differ only in the height of the DGS above the ground. Static v7
versions of these objects are supplied in the <code>v7objs</code>
folder. (Use of the DGS is optional - the boarding bridge works fine
without it - but it will be hard for the pilot to correctly position
her plane if you don't include a DGS).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Place at most one DGS at each boarding bridge.</li>
  <li>The DGS will remain blank or will display incorrect
information if it is not placed next to a boarding bridge.</li>
  <li>For correct operation, the DGS must be placed within the
highlighted region behind the bridge's "elbow":</li>
</ul>

<h3>Customisation</h3>
<p>You can rename the objects and have multiple versions with
different file names (but the rules above still apply irrespective of
the objects' names).</p>
<p>You can change the following things about the boarding
bridge(s) without breaking the system:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can re-texture the boarding bridge. As supplied, it
shares a bitmap (<code>AutoGate.png</code>) with the
Safedock DGS. The highlighted region is not used by the DGS. Or you can
use a different bitmap file for the boarding bridge(s).</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><img style="width: 384px; height: 192px;" alt="Texture layout" src="imgs/texlayout.png"><br>
<small>(this image has been rotated and reduced in size from the
original)</small></div>
<ul>
  <li>You can remove or change the centreline quad. However the
plugin
expects the centreline to be along the line x=0 and you can't change
this behaviour.</li>
  <li>You can make any changes you like to the "upper arm" and
"elbow". You can't change the <u>location</u> of the
"elbow".</li>
  <li>You can change the appearance of parts of the boarding
bridge below the "elbow" but with the following constraints:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Don't change the animations (Armature location and poses
in Blender) at all.</li>
    <li>The plugin expects that the floor of the doorway is 4m
above the ground when the object is at rest (animation frame 1 in
Blender).</li>
    <li>The plugin expects that that the edge of the doorway is
20m south and 7.5m west of an unrotated object's origin when
the object is at rest (animation frame 1 in Blender).</li>
  </ul>
  <li>As supplied, the boarding bridge includes a static reduced
level-of-detail version for distances above 1000m (in Blender this is
in Layer 2). You should retain this feature to reduce the
load on X-Plane.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use Blender then use the supplied <code>AutoGate.blend</code> file as a starting point since importing <code>AutoGate.obj</code>
will cause the animation to be lost. If you use another 3D modelling
application then check that it can correctly import and re-export <code>AutoGate.obj</code> (including animations) before you spend a lot of time editing.</p>
<p>The Safesock2S is not designed to be customisable. Contact the
<a href="mailto:x-plane@marginal.org.uk">author</a>
if you want to use a different kind of DGS.</p>
