<h2>AutoGate boarding bridge and docking guidance system kit
for X-Plane<small><sup>&reg;</sup></small></h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This kit allows X-Plane scenery designers to add animated
boarding bridges and docking guidance systems (DGS) to scenery
packages. Two boarding bridges and two types of DGS are included.</p>
<p>The boarding bridge animates to "dock" with the plane's main
door when the pilot shuts down the plane's engines with the plane
within &frac12;m of the correct stopping position. The
(optional) DGS guides the pilot to the correct stopping position.</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>The boarding bridge and DGS scenery objects are animated using
X-Plane custom datarefs. The values of these datarefs are supplied by a
plugin. The plugin needs to know the location of the main boarding door on
the plane that the user is piloting and, if the plane is an Airbus or Boeing,
the type of the plane.</p>
<ul>
  <li>In X-Plane 8.50 and later the plugin reads this information from
the "boarding door location" and "ICAO code" values in the ACF file.
These values can be edited on the Standard&nbsp;&rarr; Viewpoint screen in
Plane-Maker.</li>
  <li>The plugin also contains hard-coded values for
a few planes, including the default United 747.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the plugin is not installed or if the plugin cannot determine the
location of the main boarding door then the DGS will stay blank and the
boarding bridge will stay in the undocked position.</p>
<p>The system is designed so that it imposes no more load on
X-Plane than normal "static" scenery objects unless the user's
viewpoint is within 1000m of a boarding bridge or 500m of a DGS, in
which case the load remains very modest.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Download and install the AutoGate <a href="http://marginal.org.uk/x-planescenery/AutoGate.zip">plugin</a>. Installation instructions are in the file <code>ReadMe.txt</code>.</p>
<p>Please do not re-distribute the plugins with your scenery
package; ask your users to download them from
<a href="http://marginal.org.uk/x-planescenery/AutoGate.zip">http://marginal.org.uk/x-planescenery/AutoGate.zip</a>
instead. This ensures that they have the latest version. <small>(Future
versions of the plugin may support more bridges and/or DGSs, but will
will remain backwards-compatible)</small>. That download does not
contain any documentation on the operation of the boarding bridge or
DGS. You may wish to supply such documentation with your
scenery package; you can use
<a href="Safedock%20Pilot%20Instructions.html" target="_blank">this</a>
as a starting point.</p>
<h4>Boarding bridge</h4>
<p>Two AutoGate boarding bridge objects are supplied in the
<code>objs</code> folder - <code>AutoGate.obj</code>
(shown below) and <code>AutoGate-angled.obj</code>. Both objects use the
bitmap file <code>AutoGate.png</code>. Place as many copies of
these objects as you like in your scenery:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The bridges should be placed with the heading that
you want the plane to have when it stops at the gate.</li>
  <li>Place bridges with their origins more than 20m away from each
other. For reference, the distance between the "elbow" and "wrist" is
20m and the distance between the extended centreline and the "wrist" is
10m.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use of a DGS is optional - the AutoGate bridges work fine without it -
but it will be hard for the pilot to position the plane correctly if you
don't include a DGS. Two types of DGS are supplied:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>A Safegate<small><sup>&reg;</sup></small> inductive-loop DGS
<small>(these were installed at airports up to year 2000)</small>.</dt>
  <dd>The Safegate objects are named <code>Safegate-<i>h</i>m.obj</code> and <code>Safegate-<i>h</i>m-pole.obj</code>. These objects use the bitmap files <code>Safegate.png</code> and <code>Safegate_LIT.png</code>.
  <dt>A Safedock<small><sup>&reg;</sup></small> 2S advanced DGS
<small>(these were first installed at airports around year 2000)</small>.</dt>
  <dd>The Safedock 2S objects are named <code>Safedock2S-<i>h</i>m.obj</code> and <code>Safedock2S-<i>h</i>m-pole.obj</code>. These objects use the bitmap files <code>Safedock2S.png</code> and <code>Safedock2S_LIT.png</code>.
</dl>
<p>Various versions of these DGS objects are supplied in the
<code>objs</code> folder. These differ in the height of the DGS above the
ground and whether the DGS is mounted on a pole. You don't need to distribute
all of these objects with your scenery package - only the ones that you use.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Place at most one DGS at each AutoGate boarding bridge.</li>
  <li>The DGS will remain blank or will display incorrect
information if it is not placed next to an AutoGate boarding bridge.</li>
  <li>For correct operation, the DGS must be placed within the
highlighted region behind the AutoGate object's origin:</li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><img style="width: 362px; height: 270px;" alt="placement of GDS" src="imgs/GDSplacement.png"></div>
<ul>
  <li>The Safegate DGS works by line-of-sight, and so must
be placed on the extended centreline.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Stand-alone DGSs</h4>
<p>A second set of DGSs are supplied for use without an accompanying
AutoGate boarding bridge:<p>
<dl>
  <dt>A Safegate<small><sup>&reg;</sup></small> inductive-loop DGS.</dt>
  <dd>The stand-alone Safegate objects are named <code>SA-<i>d</i>m-Safegate-<i>h</i>m.obj</code>. These objects use the bitmap files <code>Safegate.png</code> and <code>Safegate_LIT.png</code>.
  <dt>A Safedock<small><sup>&reg;</sup></small> 2S advanced DGS.</dt>
  <dd>The stand-alone Safedock 2S objects are named <code>SA-<i>d</i>m-Safedock2S-<i>h</i>m.obj</code>. These objects use the bitmap files <code>Safedock2S.png</code> and <code>Safedock2S_LIT.png</code>.
</dl>
<p>Various versions of these stand-alone DGS objects are supplied in the
<code>objs</code> folder. These differ in the distance between the stopping
point and the DGS, and in the  height of the DGS above the ground. All of
the stand-alone DGSs are mounted on a pole. You don't need to distribute
all of these objects with your scenery package - only the ones that you use.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The DGSs should be placed with the heading that you want the plane
to have when it stops at the gate.</li>
  <li>If your scenery includes static boarding bridges, place the DGS so that
the origin of the DGS object is alongside the boarding bridge door.</li>
  <li>Place the stand-alone DGSs with their origins more than 20m away from
each other and from any AutoGate boarding bridges.</li>
</ul>      

<h3>Customisation</h3>
<p>You can rename the objects and have multiple versions with
different file names. The above rules still apply irrespective of
the objects' names.</p>
<h4>Boarding bridge</h4>
<p>You can change the following things about the boarding bridges
without breaking the system. If you do change the boarding bridge
objects and/or bitmap then I recommend giving your versions a
different file name.</p>
<p>If you use Blender then use the file <code>AutoGate.blend</code> or
<code>AutoGate-angled.blend</code> in the <code>objs</code> folder as a
starting point since importing the objects will cause the animation to be lost.
If you use another 3D modelling application then check that it can
correctly import and re-export <code>AutoGate.obj</code> (including
animations) before you spend a lot of time editing.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can re-texture the boarding bridge (if you're using Blender
don't forget to also re-texture the static version in Layer 2).</li>
  <li>You can remove or change the centreline quad. However the
plugin expects the stopping point to  be along the line x=0 and
you can't change this behaviour.</li>
  <li>You can make any changes you like to the "upper arm".</li>
  <li>You can change the parts of the boarding bridge below the "elbow"
but with the following constraints:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>When the "vert" dataref is 0 the floor of the doorway is 4m above the ground.</li>
    <li>The doorway moves 1m up when the "vert" dataref increases by 1.</li>
    <li>When the "lat" dataref is 0 the doorway is 7.5m due west of the unrotated object's origin.</li>
    <li>The doorway moves 1m towards the plane when the "lat" dataref increases by 1.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>As supplied, the boarding bridges include a static reduced
level-of-detail version for viewing at distances above 1000m (in Blender
this is in Layer 2). You should retain this feature to reduce the
load on X-Plane.</p>
<h4>Docking Guidance System</h4>
<p>The supplied DGSs are not designed to be customisable.
However the plugin publishes the following datarefs that you can
use to construct your own DGS. Contact the
<a href="mailto:x-plane@marginal.org.uk">author</a> if you would
like additional datarefs.</p>
<p>The supplied DGSs include a static reduced level-of-detail
version for viewing at distances above 500m. You should do the
same in your DGS to reduce the load on X-Plane.</p>
